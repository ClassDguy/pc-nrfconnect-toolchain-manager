                Steps to compile a first sample project with nRF Connect SDK
                (NCS), once the installation of the tools and the NCS is
                finished:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Go to <code>{sampleDir}</code> and copy one of the folders
                    (we suggest the classic <code>{suggestedExample}</code>) to
                    a folder of your liking, e.g. <code>{homeDir}</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Launch SEGGER Embedded Studio (SES) by clicking on{' '}

                </li>
                <li>
                    SES is a big IDE and can be intimidating for a first time
                    user. But do not worry, we will guide you through compiling
                    a first sample project with NCS:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Select{' '}

                        <li>
                            Select two things:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    As <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, select the
                                    one from the sample project you just copied,
                                    e.g <code>{suggestExampleCmakelists}</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For <code>Board Directory</code> select one
                                    matching your hardware from the NSC folder
                                    that was just cloned, e.g. if you have a
                                    nRF9160-DK (PCA10090), then select{' '}
                                    <code>{exampleBoardDir}</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For the other settings (
                                    <code>Board Name</code>,{' '}
                                    <code>Build Directory</code>,{' '}
                                    <code>Clean Build Directory</code>) you can
                                    usually go with the defaults on the first
                                    project.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    After clicking on OK, you have to wait a few
                                    seconds without a visual feedback. SES is
                                    just working in the background for a moment.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You now have the project set up. Compile it with
                            Buildâ†’Build solution (Shift-F7).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Attach your device and program it with

                        <li>
                            Now your device should be programmed and you should
